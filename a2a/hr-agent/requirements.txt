# HR Agent Python Dependencies
#
# This file specifies all the Python packages needed to run the HR agent.
# We keep this minimal to reduce container size and startup time.

# Starlette - Lightweight async web framework for building the HTTP server
# We use this instead of Flask because it has better async support for streaming responses
starlette>=0.37.0

# Uvicorn - ASGI server that runs our Starlette application
# This is what actually listens for HTTP requests and handles them
uvicorn>=0.30.0
