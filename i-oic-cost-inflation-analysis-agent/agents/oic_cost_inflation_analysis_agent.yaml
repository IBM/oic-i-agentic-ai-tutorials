  The Cost Inflation Analysis Agent helps users track and analyze how the cost 
  of products or services changes over time, uncovering trends and consumer sentiment 
  around price fluctuations. It is ideal for analyzing monthly price movements 
  (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, Disney+) and comparing them with public perception.
